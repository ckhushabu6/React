React Stopwatch with Sound Trigger
Objective:
Create a stopwatch that starts counting when the user clicks "Start" and plays a sound when it reaches a set time (e.g., 10 seconds). This tests useState, useEffect, and time-based logic.

Requirements:
Display elapsed seconds.

Start and Stop buttons.

On reaching 10 seconds, play a sound (use a free mp3 URL or dummy console log if needed).

Use useEffect to manage setInterval and cleanup.

Bonus:
Add a Reset button.

Allow user to set their own target time using an input.
